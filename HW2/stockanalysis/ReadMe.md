# **Stock Price Prediction Model: Development and Evolution**

## **Summary**

Built a high-precision stock price prediction system achieving 91.4% accuracy with zero false positives on upward movements. The system combines advanced technical analysis with machine learning for reliable price targets and movement predictions.

**Key Metrics:**

* Accuracy: 91.4%  
* Precision: 100%  
* Recall: 82.3%  
* High-confidence predictions with specific price targets

This changes with the stock that you are analyzing.

## **Technical Development Journey**

### **Initial Model (Base Version)**

I started with a basic stock prediction model that included:

* Simple price data from yfinance  
* Basic financial metrics (Revenue Growth, Profitability, EPS Growth)  
* A single RandomForestClassifier  
* Basic target variable (next day up/down)

Performance was moderate:

Accuracy: 0.538

Precision: 1.000

Recall: 0.250

## **First Major Iteration: Enhanced Feature Engineering**

Was able significantly improved the model by adding:

1. Technical Indicators:  
   * Multiple timeframe SMAs and EMAs  
   * Stochastic Oscillator  
   * RSI and MACD  
   * Bollinger Bands  
   * Volume indicators  
2. Market Context Features:  
   * Market correlation (Beta)  
   * Relative Strength  
   * Trend strength indicators (ADX)

This improved our metrics to:

Accuracy: 0.769

Precision: 0.727

Recall: 1.000

## **Second Major Iteration: Model Improvements**

We enhanced the modelling approach by:

1. Creating an ensemble of three models:  
   * RandomForestClassifier  
   * GradientBoostingClassifier  
   * XGBClassifier  
2. Adding sophisticated techniques:  
   * SMOTE for handling class imbalance  
   * Feature selection using mutual information  
   * Dynamic confidence thresholds

This further improved our metrics to:

Accuracy: 0.914

Precision: 1.000

Recall: 0.823

## **Final Iteration: Price Target Predictions**

We added price target predictions with the following:

1. Multiple timeframe forecasts (5, 10, 20 days)  
2. Dynamic confidence levels based on model certainty  
3. Price movement calculations considering:  
   * Historical volatility  
   * Trend strength  
   * Momentum indicators  
   * Average daily movement

## **Key Insights from Feature Importance**

The most influential features across models were:

1. Rate of Change (ROC) indicators  
2. Volume movements  
3. Trend strength (ADX)  
4. Basic price data  
5. Market context metrics

## **Model Strengths**

1. High precision (1.000) indicates extremely reliable "Up" predictions  
2. Strong recall (0.823) shows good coverage of actual upward movements  
3. Excellent overall accuracy (0.914)  
4. Conservative price targets based on model confidence

## **Model Limitations**

1. Relies heavily on technical indicators  
2. May not capture unexpected market events  
3. Predictions are probabilistic and should be used with caution  
4. Limited to daily timeframe analysis  
5. **TEST and Validate in real market**

## **Practical Applications**

The model can be used for:

1. Identifying potential entry points with high confidence  
2. Setting realistic price targets  
3. Understanding market context  
4. Risk management based on confidence levels

## **Future Improvements Could Include**

1. Add data for multiple stocks and ETFs that they are part of  
2. Writing Testing framework ???   
3. Sentiment analysis from news and social media  
4. Economic indicators integration  
5. Sector-specific features  
6. Intraday predictions  
7. Portfolio optimization based on predictions
